## Limitations
This project serves as a case study to explore the core functionalities of an e-commerce platform without delving into the complexities of external infrastructure components like load balancers, message queues etc etc... The primary focus is on understanding the fundamental building blocks of an online store. While the software can be used for commercial purposes, it's not optimized for high-traffic environments. For production-ready e-commerce solutions, consider established platforms such as nopCommerce. Feel free to fork the project and extend it for commercial use, but keep in mind that other options might be more suitable for large-scale applications.
